# Dropout
Dropout is a technique which usually takes place in the training phase and drops some nodes of a neural network to reduce overfitting. 

The overall idea is that dropping (or deactivating) nodes helps the network concentrate on other features so that a network does not fit too closely to the limited dataset provided during the training phase.
